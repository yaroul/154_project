The r files include all the codes we wrote and all results we obtained. They are organized in a similar way as the the final report. So you can always refer to the rmd file and the knited pdf for further details.

1. Import Data

2. General Variable Selection

    Here we set some variables to null as they are either redudant with other variables or not very useful for classification.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis

    Analyzing the data more closely. Using ggplot to graph the count of categorical variables' levels and proportion of them earning more than 50k per year. We also graphed quantitative variables in terms of count and proportion.
    
    - Categorical variables: workclass, race, maritual status, sex, occupation, native country.
    
    - Quantitative variables: age, years of education, hours worked each week.
    
    - Binning Varibales
    
       Binned variables: marital status, workclass, occupation, native country
 4. Data Analysis and Prediction

    1. Classification Tree

    2. Bagged Tree

    3. Random Forest

    4. Model Selection

###### Final_Report.pdf

As mention above, the official report is organized similar to the r files for easy reference. However, the official report includes more written analysis.

1. Introduction

2. Exploritoray Data Analysis
