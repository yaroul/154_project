- General Variable Selection

    Here we set some variables to null as they are either redudant with other variables or not very useful for classification.
- Exploratory Data Analysis

    Analyzing the data more closely. Using ggplot to graph the count of categorical variables' levels and proportion of them earning more than 50k per year. We also graphed quantitative variables in terms of count and proportion.
